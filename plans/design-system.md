# Design System & Component Library

This document outlines the design system for Emulsion, serving as a reference for UI consistency across the application.

## DESIGN MODE

**Rule**: We avoid one-off styling inside individual pages (including `DesignSystemPage.jsx`). Instead, we define reusable, global foundations (tokens + base styles + component utilities) that can be applied across the whole site.

## Design Style: Contemporary Film Craft (Light Mode)

### 1) Design Philosophy
This style blends **cinematic warmth with streamlined utility** for film inventory management. It celebrates the craft of analog photography while ensuring every interface decision serves clarity and workflow efficiency. Think of it as a well-stocked studio—organized, inspiring, and invitingly practical.

**Core Vibe**: craft-conscious yet accessible, thoughtfully efficient, visually engaging without distraction, warm professionalism.

**Principles**:
- TO be filled

### 2) Design Tokens (Light Mode)

**Colors**:
- TO be filled

**Typography**:
- TO be filled

**Radius & Shapes**:
- TO be filled

**Shadows** (soft, diffused):
- TO be filled

**Texture Overlay**:
- TO be filled

### 3) Component Guidelines

**Buttons**:
- TO be filled

**Cards**:

Cards that can be interacted (drag-droppable is tactile).

**Inputs & Forms**:
- TO be filled

**Data Display**:
- TO be filled

### 4) Constraints
- **Do not modify** `frontend/src/components/stats/cards/FilmStockGalleryCard.jsx`

## Implementation Plan

We will evolve the global design system by:
0. Creating a design system test page that features all components across the site.
1. Centralizing design tokens (CSS variables / Tailwind extensions)
2. Adding global base styles (fonts, background, texture overlay)
3. Creating reusable utility classes for buttons, cards, and inputs
