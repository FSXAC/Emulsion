# Active Context

## Current Focus
Core Status: **Palette Selection Phase**
- ✅ Updated design-system.md with neubrutalism vision
- ✅ Created visual palette mockups in DesignSystemPage.jsx
- 🚧 Waiting for palette selection decision

The **Design System** is now the primary focus. We're implementing a new style globally instead of modifying individual pages directly.

## Recent Changes
- Created `StatsPage.jsx`, `StatCard.jsx`.
- Implemented `statsCalculator.js` for frontend-side metrics.
- Added Recharts for visualization.
- Drafted `plans/plan-devchart.md` for proper Chemistry Development Chart feature.

## Active Documents
- `plans/plan-statistics.md`: Primary guide for current work.
- `plans/plan-devchart.md`: Upcoming feature (next in line).

## Open Questions / Decisions
- **Gallery Performance**: Rendering many high-res film stock images might need optimization.
- **Dev Chart**: Need to decide on final schema for development times before starting Phase 15.

## Next Steps
1. Complete **Gallery Tab** implementation (Phase 14.8).
2. Refine Mobile experience for Statistics page.
3. Review and finalize **Dev Chart** plan.
4. Begin **Dev Chart** backend implementation (Phase 15).
