Implementation of the **Statistics Page** (Phase 14).
Core Status: **Partially Complete**
- ✅ Overview Tab (Metrics, Charts)
- ✅ Costs Tab (Analysis)
- 🚧 Gallery Tab (In Progress)

The **Gallery Tab** is the current active task. It involves displaying a grid of film stock thumbnails, filtering by format/status/rating, and viewing roll details.

## Recent Changes
- Created `StatsPage.jsx`, `StatCard.jsx`.
- Implemented `statsCalculator.js` for frontend-side metrics.
- Added Recharts for visualization.

## Active Documents
- `plans/plan-statistics.md`: Primary guide for current work.
- `plans/plan-devchart.md`: Upcoming feature (next in line).

## Open Questions / Decisions
- **Gallery Performance**: Rendering many high-res film stock images might need optimization.
- **Dev Chart**: Need to decide on final schema for development times before starting Phase 15.

## Next Steps
1. Complete **Gallery Tab** implementation (Phase 14.8).
2. Refine Mobile experience for Statistics page.
3. Review and finalize **Dev Chart** plan.
4. Begin **Dev Chart** backend implementation (Phase 15).
